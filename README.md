## Planning and Development Process:
I started from desinging the layouts for each screen in my application. I have selected the colors I want to use in hole app. After that, I started to design them in xml files. Then, I moved to start coding.
### Problems-solving strategy:
If have some obstacles at a certain point I serach about that point. if I do not find it, asked classmates or instructional team.

## Unsolved problems:
- wripe itemview to change its position.
- minimize listview.
- sorting list by checked box.

## Favorite functions:
 spinner and time and date dialog because I really enjoyed to do them. I had some problems when I was working on it but, they showed the expected result.
